## How to a node

1. Create a new folder with a *descriptive* name for the new node. This
folder should contain the entire documentation, images and source code.

2. Create a reference for the new node in the [Sensor nodes list](#sensor-nodes) above.

## Node documentation guidelines

- **General guideline:** It should be possible to re-build and program
this node based on this documentation.

- Include images in your documentation

- **Mask sensitive information** like passwords, tokens, access keys, EUIs, in code and documentation!
